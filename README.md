12. If the delivery truck is the most economical but the slowest shipping method and
Express Air is the fastest but the most expensive one, do you think the company
appropriately spent shipping costs based on the Order Priority? Explain your answer

- The shipping cost pattern does not appear to be a clear reflection of the order priority. For instance, critical prders should be shiped through Express air and should have a highest cost due to the urgency in the order. In this order, the High priority order should follow, the the low and the not specified shpuld come last.

- Therefore, studing the data, it shows that the company did not appropraitely spend shipping costs based on the order priority. Express air was used to ship even products with low and not specified order priority as against the delivery truck that should have been used to safe cost.
